## Note from MeatWheeze

I'm not sure whether the 1.21 branch will build or work.

This fork contains some jank to only allow loading models from certain namespaces so that it doesn't interfere with other OBJ loading systems.

> Currently, the 1.21 branch probably won't build.

## Note from BlueVista
This fork is just a port to 1.19.4. If you would like to use it, it's on my personal maven.
```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url "https://lazurite.dev/releases" }
}

dependencies {
    modImplementation "dev.monarkhes:myron:1.6.2+1.20.1" 
}
```

### TODO - Make compatible with latest FAPI (new model loading registry api)

# Myron ![latest version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Haven-King/Myron)
An OBJ loading library for the fabric ecosystem
